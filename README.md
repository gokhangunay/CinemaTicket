Final project example for OBSS Java Summer School 2014.

Notice
======

In order the application to work, you have to create a file named `app.properties` with the following content:

```
db.url=db_url
db.user=db_user
db.pass=db_password
```
Be sure to replace `db_*` values with appropriate ones for your environment.
